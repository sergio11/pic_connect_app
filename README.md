## Technology Stack

PicConnect is built using the following technologies:

- **Flutter**: We chose Flutter as the primary framework for developing PicConnect due to its cross-platform capabilities. With a single codebase, we can deploy our app on both Android and iOS, ensuring a consistent user experience across platforms.

- **Firebase**: Firebase provides a robust backend-as-a-service (BaaS) platform, which powers PicConnect's user authentication, real-time database, and cloud storage. Firebase offers seamless integration with Flutter, making it an ideal choice for building real-time and interactive features in our app.

- **SQLite**: For local data storage, we use SQLite, a lightweight and efficient database engine that is well-suited for mobile app development.

- **Dart**: The Dart programming language is the backbone of Flutter, and we use it extensively to write clean and efficient code for our app.

## Why Flutter and Firebase

We chose Flutter and Firebase for PicConnect for the following reasons:

- **Cross-Platform Development**: Flutter allows us to write a single codebase for both Android and iOS, reducing development time and maintenance efforts.

- **Rich User Interfaces**: Flutter's widget-based architecture makes it easy to create beautiful and responsive user interfaces, ensuring an engaging user experience.

- **Real-Time Features**: Firebase offers real-time database capabilities, making it perfect for features like real-time messaging and notifications in PicConnect.

- **Scalability**: Firebase scales effortlessly with the growth of our user base, ensuring a seamless experience for all users.
