- **Direct Messaging**: Chat with your friends and followers through our built-in messaging system.

## Technology Stack

PicConnect is built using the following technologies:

- **Flutter**: We chose Flutter as the primary framework for developing PicConnect due to its cross-platform capabilities. With a single codebase, we can deploy our app on both Android and iOS, ensuring a consistent user experience across platforms.

- **Firebase**: Firebase provides a robust backend-as-a-service (BaaS) platform, which powers PicConnect's user authentication, real-time database, and cloud storage. Firebase offers seamless integration with Flutter, making it an ideal choice for building real-time and interactive features in our app.

- **SQLite**: For local data storage, we use SQLite, a lightweight and efficient database engine that is well-suited for mobile app development.

- **Dart**: The Dart programming language is the backbone of Flutter, and we use it extensively to write clean and efficient code for our app.

## Why Flutter and Firebase

We chose Flutter and Firebase for PicConnect for the following reasons:

- **Cross-Platform Development**: Flutter allows us to write a single codebase for both Android and iOS, reducing development time and maintenance efforts.

- **Rich User Interfaces**: Flutter's widget-based architecture makes it easy to create beautiful and responsive user interfaces, ensuring an engaging user experience.

- **Real-Time Features**: Firebase offers real-time database capabilities, making it perfect for features like real-time messaging and notifications in PicConnect.

- **Scalability**: Firebase scales effortlessly with the growth of our user base, ensuring a seamless experience for all users.

# Software Architecture

## Clean Architecture

This project adheres to the principles of **Clean Architecture**, a design approach that promotes separation of concerns and independence of layers within an application. It offers advantages such as testability, scalability, and code maintainability.

The architecture is organized into the following layers:

### 1. Presentation Layer (UI)

- **Description**: The presentation layer handles the user interface and user interactions. In this layer, we implement the BLoC pattern to manage UI state and user actions.

- **Technology**: We leverage Flutter's capabilities to efficiently develop the presentation layer.

### 2. Business Layer (BLoC - Business Logic Component)

- **Description**: The business layer contains application logic not directly tied to the user interface. Here, we define UseCases that encapsulate specific business requirements. These UseCases manage the application state and control data flow.

- **Technology**: In Flutter, we utilize packages like `flutter_bloc` to effectively implement BLoCs and organize business logic.

### 3. Data Layer

- **Description**: The data layer is responsible for accessing and managing application data. It interfaces with different data sources, abstracting their implementation details. Repositories act as bridges between UseCases and data sources.

- **Technology**: We use packages like `http` for making HTTP requests and databases like SQLite or ORM packages for local storage. The use of data sources allows us to connect with Firestore and FireStorage.

### 4. Domain Layer

- **Description**: The domain layer hosts pure business logic and application business rules. It should be isolated from specific data layer or presentation layer implementations. Here, we define the core business entities.

- **Technology**: This layer is generally free from external libraries and should remain technology-agnostic.

## UseCases, Repositories, and Data Sources

In this project, we've encapsulated business requirements in **UseCases**, which are responsible for orchestrating various operations. These UseCases interact with one or more repositories, injecting them via Inversion of Control (IoC) using GetIt.

- **UseCases**: These are the heart of the application's business logic, serving as intermediaries between the presentation and data layers. They encapsulate specific use cases, such as creating a new post, fetching user data, or handling authentication.

- **Repositories**: Repositories serve as interfaces between UseCases and data sources. They abstract the data layer's implementation, allowing us to switch between different data sources (Firestore, FireStorage, HTTP, local database) without affecting the business logic.

- **Data Sources**: Data sources manage concrete aspects of data storage. In your project, Firestore and FireStorage are the primary data sources for handling persistence. These data sources are encapsulated within repositories and accessed through well-defined interfaces.

## Advantages of Clean Architecture and Abstraction

- **Maintainability**: Clean architecture promotes separation of concerns, making it easier to maintain and update different parts of the application independently.

- **Scalability**: The architecture accommodates application growth, allowing you to extend functionality without causing major disruptions.

- **Testability**: By isolating business logic in UseCases and abstracting data sources, the codebase becomes highly testable, enabling efficient unit testing.

- **Flexibility**: The abstraction of data sources through repositories makes it possible to switch or add new data sources seamlessly, without extensive code modifications.

This architecture provides a robust foundation for your project, enabling efficient development, testing, and future expansion. It allows you to focus on implementing business logic while abstracting away the complexities of data storage and retrieval using Firestore and FireStorage.

## Getting Started

To get started with PicConnect, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

```shell
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/pic-connect.git
```

2. **Install dependencies:**

```shell
  cd pic-connect
  flutter pub get
```

3. **Run the app:**

```shell
  flutter run
```

4. **Configure Firebase:**

- Create a Firebase project: [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
- Add your Android and iOS apps to the Firebase project and download the configuration files (google-services.json and GoogleService-Info.plist).
- Place the configuration files in the `android/app` and `ios/Runner` directories.

5. **Set up your Firebase Realtime Database:**

- Define the database rules to secure your data.
- Initialize Firebase in your app by following the FlutterFire documentation: [FlutterFire](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup)
